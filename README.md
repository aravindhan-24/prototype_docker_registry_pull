# Prototype Docker Registry Pull

A Java-based prototype demonstrating the mechanics of pulling Docker images from a registry.

## 🔍 Overview

This project simulates the process of pulling Docker images from a registry, providing insights into the underlying steps and interactions involved.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Simulated Pull Process**: Emulates the steps involved in pulling Docker images.
- **Java Implementation**: Developed using Java to demonstrate the process programmatically.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `dynamicPull.java`: Implements a dynamic approach to simulate the pull process.
- `staticPull.java`: Implements a static approach to simulate the pull process.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/aravindhan-24/prototype_docker_registry_pull.git
   cd prototype_docker_registry_pull


2. Compile the Java files:

   javac dynamicPull.java staticPull.java

3. Run the desired simulation:

   java dynamicPull

   java staticPull
